# Most folks might have come across JSON format already. 
# Here is one example of how a JSON formatted data would look like for those who have not. 

# JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
# JSON is a text format for storing and transporting data
# 

# For example, the following command in Linux Bash will generate a JSON output: 

$  echo "{\"filename\":\"AFileName\",\"Size\":\"35 Gbytes\"}"
{"filename":"AFileName","Size":"35 Gbytes"}

# As you can see there is an object with two properties in the above JSON formatted output, "filename" and "Size". 

# Now you want to format the output in a more human readable way or manipulate the output, such as choosing which property to show etc. 
# The "jq" command is handy for these types of actions. 
# The simplest and most basic usage of "jq" is as the following: 


$ echo "{\"filename\":\"AFileName\",\"Size\":\"35 Gbytes\"}" |jq .
{
  "filename": "AFileName",
  "Size": "35 Gbytes"
}

# Now this text does not have colors but if you are using a Linux Bash terminal, you will see a more readable output, highlighted with colors.
